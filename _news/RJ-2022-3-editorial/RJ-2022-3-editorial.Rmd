On behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 14 Issue 3 of the R Journal.

\noindent Our incoming editor-in-chief for 2023 Simon Urbanek has been successful in seeking funding from the R Consortium. The project will provide a web-based front-end for managing the R Journal submission and  review process.

\noindent Behind the scenes, several people  assist with the journal operations. Mitchell O'Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, and thanks to this work, producing a new issue is far more straightforward.  H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the  \CRANpkg{rjtools} package under the direction of Professor Dianne Cook. This package, recently available from CRAN assists in producing RMarkdown articles in the R Journal format.  In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.



## In this issue

News from the CRAN and Bioconductor are included in this issue. 


\noindent This issue features 18 contributed research articles the majority of which relate to R packages
on a diverse range of topics. All packages are available on CRAN. The most common article keywords in this issue are

```{r keywords,  fig.width=5, fig.height=3,fig.alt="Article keywords occuring more than once",fig.cap = " ", eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rj)
tabulate_articles("Proofs/2022-3") |> select(id, title, keywords) -> keys
keys |> mutate(keywords = strsplit(keywords, ",")) |> unnest(keywords) |> mutate(keywords = trimws(keywords)) -> keys1
top <- keys1 |> count(keywords) |> arrange(desc(n))

top |> filter( n>=2) |>
  ggplot(aes(y=reorder(keywords,n), x=n))+ 
  geom_pointrange(xmin=0, aes(xmax =n))+ 
  ylab(NULL)+ 
  xlim(c(0,max(top$n))) + 
  theme_minimal()+ xlab("Keyword Frequency")

```

```{r ,  out.width="50%",fig.alt="Article keywords occuring more than once",  eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/keywords-1.png")
```
 

\noindent For the first time, we give times from submission to article acceptabce for an issue. Median times are just under a year, which is consistent other issues over the last few years.



```{r days,  fig.width=4, fig.height=3,fig.alt="Time from submission to accept in days", eval=FALSE}
tabulate_articles("Proofs/2022-3") |> 
  unnest(status) |>
  filter(status %in% c("submitted", "accepted")) |>
  group_by(id) |> 
  summarise(days = max(date)- min(date)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=days))+ geom_histogram(bins=8, fill="lightblue", color="grey10")+ 
  theme_minimal()+ ylab("Frequency")+ xlab("Days from submission to accept")

```

```{r,  out.width="50%",fig.alt="Time from submission to accept in days", eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/days-1.png")

```
