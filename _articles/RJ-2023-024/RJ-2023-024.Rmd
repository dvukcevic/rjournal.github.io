title: 'gplsim: An R Package for Generalized Partially Linear Single-index Models'
abstract: Generalized partially linear single-index models (GPLSIMs) are important
  tools in nonparametric regression. They extend popular generalized linear models
  to allow flexible nonlinear dependence on some predictors while overcoming the "curse
  of dimensionality." We develop an R package gplsim that implements efficient spline
  estimation of GPLSIMs, proposed by [@yu_penalized_2002] and [@yu_penalised_2017],
  for a response variable from a general exponential family. The package builds upon
  the popular mgcv package for generalized additive models (GAMs) and provides functions
  that allow users to fit GPLSIMs with various link functions, select smoothing tuning
  parameter $\lambda$ against generalized cross-validation or alternative choices,
  and visualize the estimated unknown univariate function of single-index term. In
  this paper, we discuss the implementation of gplsim in detail, and illustrate the
  use case through a sine-bump simulation study with various links and a real-data
  application to air pollution data.
