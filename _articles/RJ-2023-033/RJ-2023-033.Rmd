title: Robust Functional Linear Regression Models
abstract: With advancements in technology and data storage, the availability of functional
  data whose sample observations are recorded over a continuum, such as time, wavelength,
  space grids, and depth, progressively increases in almost all scientific branches.
  The functional linear regression models, including scalar-on-function and function-on-function,
  have become popular tools for exploring the functional relationships between the
  scalar response-functional predictors and functional response-functional predictors,
  respectively. However, most existing estimation strategies are based on non-robust
  estimators that are seriously hindered by outlying observations, which are common
  in applied research. In the case of outliers, the non-robust methods lead to undesirable
  estimation and prediction results. Using a readily-available [R]{.sans-serif} package
  robflreg, this paper presents several robust methods build upon the functional principal
  component analysis for modeling and predicting scalar-on-function and function-on-function
  regression models in the presence of outliers. The methods are demonstrated via
  simulated and empirical datasets.
