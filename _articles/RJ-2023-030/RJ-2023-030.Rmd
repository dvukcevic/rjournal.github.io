title: 'The segmetric Package: Metrics for Assessing Segmentation Accuracy for Geospatial
  Data'
abstract: ' Segmentation methods are a valuable tool for exploring spatial data by
  identifying objects based on images'' features. However, proper segmentation assessment
  is critical for obtaining high-quality results and running well-tuned segmentation
  algorithms Usually, various metrics are used to inform different types of errors
  that dominate the results. We describe a new R package, [segmetric](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=segmetric),
  for assessing and analyzing the geospatial segmentation of satellite images. This
  package unifies code and knowledge spread across different software implementations
  and research papers to provide a variety of supervised segmentation metrics available
  in the literature. It also allows users to create their own metrics to evaluate
  the accuracy of segmented objects based on reference polygons. We hope this package
  helps to fulfill some of the needs of the R community that works with Earth Observation
  data. '
