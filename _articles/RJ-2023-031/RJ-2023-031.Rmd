title: 'Onlineforecast: An R Package for Adaptive and Recursive Forecasting'
abstract: Systems that rely on forecasts to make decisions, e.g. control or energy
  trading systems, require frequent updates of the forecasts. Usually, the forecasts
  are updated whenever new observations become available, hence in an online setting.
  We present the [R]{.sans-serif} package [[onlineforecast](https://onlineforecasting.org)]{.sans-serif}
  that provides a generalized setup of data and models for online forecasting. It
  has functionality for time-adaptive fitting of dynamical and non-linear models.
  The setup is tailored to enable the effective use of forecasts as model inputs,
  e.g. numerical weather forecast. Users can create new models for their particular
  applications and run models in an operational setting. The package also allows users
  to easily replace parts of the setup, e.g. using new methods for estimation. The
  package comes with comprehensive vignettes and examples of online forecasting applications
  in energy systems, but can easily be applied for online forecasting in all fields.
