title: 'combinIT: An R Package for Combining Interaction Tests for Unreplicated Two-Way
  Tables'
abstract: ' Several new tests have been proposed for testing interaction in unreplicated
  two-way analysis of variance models. Unfortunately, each test is powerful for detecting
  a pattern of interaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to combine multiple interaction
  tests to increase the power of detection for significant interactions. We introduce
  the package [combinIT](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=combinIT) that provides
  researchers the results of six existing recommended interaction tests, including:
  the value of test statistics, exact Monte Carlo p-values, approximated or adjusted
  p-values, the results of four combined tests and explanations of interaction types
  if the discussed tests are significant. The software combinIT is a more comprehensive
  R package in comparison with the two existing packages. In addition, the software
  is executed quickly to obtain the exact Monte Carlo p-values, even for large Monte
  Carlo runs, in contrast to existing packages. '
