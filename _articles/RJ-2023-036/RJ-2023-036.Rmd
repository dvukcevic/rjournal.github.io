title: 'Resampling Fuzzy Numbers with Statistical Applications: FuzzyResampling Package'
abstract: ' The classical bootstrap has proven its usefulness in many areas of statistical
  inference. However, some shortcomings of this method are also known. Therefore,
  various bootstrap modifications and other resampling algorithms have been introduced,
  especially for real-valued data. Recently, bootstrap methods have become popular
  in statistical reasoning based on imprecise data often modeled by fuzzy numbers.
  One of the challenges faced there is to create bootstrap samples of fuzzy numbers
  which are similar to initial fuzzy samples but different in some way at the same
  time. These methods are implemented in [FuzzyResampling](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FuzzyResampling)
  package and applied in different statistical functions like single-sample or two-sample
  tests for the mean. Besides describing the aforementioned functions, some examples
  of their applications as well as numerical comparisons of the classical bootstrap
  with the new resampling algorithms are provided in this contribution. '
