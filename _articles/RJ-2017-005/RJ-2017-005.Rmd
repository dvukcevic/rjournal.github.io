title: 'alineR: an R Package for Optimizing Feature-Weighted Alignments and Linguistic
  Distances'
abstract: 'Linguistic distance measurements are commonly used in anthropology and
  biology when quantitative and statistical comparisons between words are needed.
  This is common, for example, when analyzing linguistic and genetic data. Such comparisons
  can provide insight into historical population patterns and evolutionary processes.
  However, the most commonly used linguistic distances are derived from edit distances,
  which do not weight phonetic features that may, for example, represent smaller-scale
  patterns in linguistic evolution. Thus, computational methods for calculating feature-weighted
  linguistic distances are needed for linguistic, biological, and evolutionary applications;
  additionally, the linguistic distances presented here are generic and may have broader
  applications in fields such as text mining and search, as well as applications in
  psycholinguistics and morphology. To facilitate this research, we are making available
  an open-source R software package that performs feature-weighted linguistic distance
  calculations. The package also includes a supervised learning methodology that uses
  a genetic algorithm and manually determined alignments to estimate 13 linguistic
  parameters including feature weights and a skip penalty. Here we present the package
  and use it to demonstrate the supervised learning methodology by estimating the
  optimal linguistic parameters for both simulated data and for a sample of Austronesian
  languages. Our results show that the methodology can estimate these parameters for
  both simulated and real language data, that optimizing feature weights improves
  alignment accuracy by approximately 29%, and that optimization significantly affects
  the resulting distance measurements. Availability: alineR is available on CRAN.'
