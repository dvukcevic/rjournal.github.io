When designing the user API for \pkg{detourr}, a data-oriented approach is taken to make it approachable, and the visuals are built in JavaScript to enable rich user interactions. \pkg{detourr} also supports the full suite of tour path generating functions from the \pkg{tourr} package. The result is an experience that is feature-rich, immersive, and accessible to newcomers.

This chapter is structured as follows. The first section describes the user API in R and supported features, the second describes how the user can interact with the resulting visual. Throughout the chapter, we use the `pdfSense` dataset (@wang2018mapping; @lee2021liminal) to provide a running example. This data set consists of 2808 observations and 56 input variables from  CT14HERA parton distribution function fits. The first 6 principal components are used to create the tour, accounting for ~55% of the variance in the data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# remotes::install_github('casperhart/detourr@v0.1.0')

library(detourr)
data(pdfsense, package = "liminal")

pcs <- pdfsense |>
    dplyr::select(X1:X56) |>
    prcomp()

pcs <- as_tibble(pcs$x) |>
    dplyr::select(PC1:PC6)

pdf_df <- pdfsense |>
    dplyr::select(-(X1:X56)) |>
    mutate(Type = as.character(Type)) |>
    bind_cols(pcs)
```

## User interface

\pkg{detourr} has a data-oriented user interface heavily influenced by the Tidy Data (@tidydata) workflow, Grammar of Graphics (@wilkinson2012grammar; @wickham2010layered), and \CRANpkg{ggplot2} (@wickham2016ggplot2). The visualisation is built in a sequence of steps which follow the logical flow of data in the tour building process, which makes the API intuitive and accessible.

### Instantiating the tour

To begin, we instantiate a tour using the `detour()` function:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p <- detour(pdf_df, tour_aes(
    projection = starts_with("PC"),
    colour = Type,
    label = ID
))
```

The first argument to `detour()` is a data frame in tidy format containing the tour data and aesthetics. Enforcing the use of data frames encourages data-centric statistical thinking. The second argument defines the aesthetic mapping of data variables through the `tour_aes()` function, similar to \pkg{ggplot2}. The currently supported aesthetics are:

- `projection`: (required) the numeric columns to be projected
- `colour`: point colour
- `label`: label text to be shown when the mouse is hovered over a point.

These mappings support tidy evaluation and \CRANpkg{tidyselect} syntax (@tidyselect) such as `starts_with()`, `where(is.numeric())`, column ranges using `col_1:col_n`, negation `-col_n`, and others, for easier column selection.

### Generating the tour path

Once the tour is initialised with the data and aesthetics, the tour path is defined by piping the output from `detour()` to the `tour_path()` function. Note that `|>` is the pipe operator introduced in R 4.1:

\pagebreak

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p <- p |> tour_path(grand_tour(3))
p
```

The `tour_path()` function defines parameters for the tour such as:

- `tour_path`: the tour path generator, e.g. `grand_tour()`, `guided_tour()`, or any other path generator compatible with the \pkg{tourr} package
- `start`: the starting basis or projection matrix
- `fps`: frames per second with which to display the animation. Defaults to 30 but can be increased for a smoother animation or decreased for very large data.
- `max_bases`:  the number of basis frames to generate. A higher number will give a longer tour animation.

The resulting `detour` object is stored in a standard data frame for easy consumption and inspection. It contains the full details of the tour path, where the $i^{th}$ row corresponds to the $i^{th}$ animation frame of the tour, with the following columns:

1. `is_new_basis`: whether the projection matrix corresponds to a new basis (`TRUE`) or is interpolated (`FALSE`)
2. `projection_matrix`: the projection matrix.

This form gives the user full visibility of the tour path, and allows the projection matrices to be traced and extracted for further analyses.

### Creating the animation

To display the tour animation, we simply pipe the output of `tour_path()` to any of the functions prefixed with `show_` provided by the \pkg{detourr} package. The available display functions are:

- `show_scatter()`: the core 2D or 3D scatter plot display
- `show_slice()`: a slice tour display based on @laa2020slice
- `show_sage()`: a sage tour implementation based on @laa2021burning

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
p |> show_scatter(axes = FALSE)
```
 
```{r scatter-display-static, fig.cap = "Initial frame of the scatterplot display generated by the `show\\_scatter` display function. Controls are on the left, and an interactive timeline is on the bottom of the plot.", eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/implementation/pdfsense_scatter_3d.png")
```

```{r scatter-display-interactive, fig.cap = "Interactive scatterplot display generated by the `show_scatter` display function. Controls are on the left, and an interactive timeline is on the bottom of the plot.", eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
p |> show_scatter(axes = FALSE, size = 0.5)
```

The output of `tour_path()` becomes the input of `show_*()`, forming a fluent pipeline. For the three display methods described above, the common parameters are:

- `palette`: the colour palette to use for the tour.
- `center`: whether the data should be centred before displaying.
- `axes`: whether to show axis / what the axis titles should be
- `edges`: a two-column numeric matrix defining indices of points where line segments should be drawn between
- `paused`: whether the animation should be initialised in a paused state.
- `scale_factor`: used to scale the points in or out so that they appear on a sensible range, similar to a zoom function. Defaults to the reciprocal of maximum distance from a point to the origin, so that the points fit inside a unit ball. 

There are also parameters specific to each display method, such as `slice_relative_volume` for `show_slice()`, and `gamma` and `R` for `show_sage()`. These details will be described further in the Display Methods section.

\pagebreak

Putting all of this together, we have:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
detour(pdf_df, tour_aes(
    projection = starts_with("PC"),
    colour = Type,
    label = ID
)) |>
    tour_path(grand_tour(3)) |>
    show_scatter()
```

This chaining process allows us to construct the tour visualisation incrementally in a way that is intuitive and easy to follow. The user is able to inspect the result at each step in the chain, and it aligns well with the _grammar of graphics_ and _tidy data_ workflows. This makes \pkg{detourr} accessible to newcomers who may not have worked with tours previously.

## Interactivity

 Presently, several well-developed R packages allow the use of web technologies in R; \pkg{htmlwidgets} allows binding R code with HTML and JavaScript to create standalone widgets; \pkg{shiny} provides features for combining various elements in to interactive web applications powered by R; \CRANpkg{crosstalk} (@crosstalk) enables linked selection and brushing between different HTML Widgets; and \CRANpkg{rmarkdown} (@rmarkdown) allows creating HTML documents with HTML Widgets embedded within. The use of web technologies such as JavaScript enable the resulting visuals to be portable and accessible, and enable the implementation of rich interactive features. In this section we will describe these interactive features and how they can be configured.

### Label aesthetics

In the above example, labels are defined within the call to `tour_aes()`, which contains all of the aesthetic mappings for the tour. The `label` aesthetic produces a tooltip which is shown whenever the mouse is hovered over the data point. By default, the text in the tooltip will have the format `column_name: value`, with each specified column on a new line. If users want more control over what appears in the tooltip, one can use the `I()` function so that the values in the aesthetic column appear as-is. For example in \@ref(fig:hover-tooltip), the left plot specifies the label aesthetic as `label = c(InFit, Type, ID, pt, x, mu)` and the right is specifies the label as-is by using `label = I(ID)` in the call to `tour_aes()`. When using the `I()` function for the label aesthetic, only one column can be specified at a time.

```{r hover-tooltip, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.ncol=2, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="(Left) Tooltip showing data from the 6 columns specified in the `label` aesthetic. Note that both the column names and values are present in the tooltip. (Right) The `ID` column is provided as-is to the label aesthetic via the `I()` function."}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
    "figures/implementation/hover_tooltip.png",
    "figures/implementation/hover_tooltip_asis.png"
))
```


### Controls

Table `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(tab:html-controls)', '\\@ref(tab:pdf-controls)'))` shows a breakdown of the controls found on the left side of the visual. Note that the icon for the currently selected control will be highlighted blue; otherwise it will be black. When the icons are hovered over in the `show_scatter()` widget, alternative text will be shown.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
controls_df <- tibble(
    Control = c("Orbit", "Pan", "Box Selection", "Brush", "Colour Selector"),
    Icon = paste0(
        "figures/implementation/",
        c(
            "orbit_control_button.png",
            "pan_button.png",
            "select_button.png",
            "brush.png",
            "colour_selector.png"
        )
    ),
    Description = c(
        "When the `show_scatter()` widget is generated, orbit controls will be enabled by default. This allows click and drag to rotate the visual, and scrolling/pinching to zoom. Note that orbit controls for the 2D variant work best if dragging from left to right, not up and down. Also note that the icon for the currently selected control will be highlighted blue; otherwise it will be black.",
        "The pan control also allows scrolling to zoom, and click and drag to pan.",
        "The selection control allows for transitory box selection by brushing. Holding the `shift` key will allow for persistent selection, and points outside of the selection will be indicated by increased transparency. There is currently a limitation where only visible points can be selected. If a point is completely obscured by other points, it will not be selected.",
        "The brush button will apply the current colour to the selected points.",
        "The colour selector will look slightly different depending on the browser being used. When the colour selection is changed, the selected points will be updated immediately."
    )
)
```

```{r html-controls, eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
html_table <- controls_df |>
    mutate(Icon = paste0("![](", Icon, ")"))
knitr::kable(html_table,
    format = "html",
    caption = "An overview of the interactive controls available in the detourr displays"
)
```

```{r pdf-controls, eval=knitr::is_latex_output()}
pdf_table <- controls_df |>
    mutate(
        Icon = paste0(
            "\\raisebox{-\\totalheight}{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{", Icon, "}}"
        ),
        Description = gsub("\\_", "\\\\_", Description)
    )

knitr::kable(pdf_table,
    format = "latex", caption = "An overview of the interactive controls available in the \\pkg{detourr} displays",
    escape = FALSE,
    booktabs = TRUE
) |>
    kable_styling() |>
    column_spec(1, width = "0.2\\\\textwidth") |>
    column_spec(2, width = "0.2\\\\textwidth") |>
    column_spec(3, width = "0.6\\\\textwidth") |>
    row_spec(1:4, hline_after = TRUE)
```

```{r brushing, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.ncol=2, fig.show="hold", fig.cap="An illustration of the box selection and brush tool being used together."}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0("figures/implementation/pdfsense-brushing-", 1:4, ".png"))
```

### Timeline controls

The timeline at the bottom of the widget controls play and pause, and allows for scrubbing to a specific point in the tour. The timeline can also be used to jump to a specific basis by clicking on any of the white basis markers, and hovering the mouse over the basis markers will display the index of that basis.

### Linked selection and filtering

\pkg{detourr} supports linked selection and filtering by integrating with \pkg{crosstalk}. When a \pkg{crosstalk} `SharedData` object is provided to `detour()` in place of a data frame, selections made using the _box selection_ tool will be reflected in all linked visuals. Likewise, any selection or filtering applied to a linked visual will be reflected by \pkg{detourr}. Compatible widgets include \CRANpkg{plotly} (@plotly), \CRANpkg{leaflet} (@leaflet), and \CRANpkg{DT} (@dt). An example of this is shown in the case study.
