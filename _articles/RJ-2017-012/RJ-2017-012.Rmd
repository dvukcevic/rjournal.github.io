title: Multilabel Classification with R Package mlr
abstract: We implemented several multilabel classification algorithms in the machine
  learning package mlr. The implemented methods are binary relevance, classifier chains,
  nested stacking, dependent binary relevance and stacking, which can be used with
  any base learner that is accessible in mlr. Moreover, there is access to the multilabel
  classification versions of randomForestSRC and rFerns. All these methods can be
  easily compared by different implemented multilabel performance measures and resampling
  methods in the standardized mlr framework. In a benchmark experiment with several
  multilabel datasets, the performance of the different methods is evaluated.
