title: 'genpathmox: An R Package to Tackle Numerous Categorical Variables and Heterogeneity
  in Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling'
abstract: Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), combined with
  the analysis of the effects of categorical variables after estimating the model,
  is a well-established statistical approach to the study of complex relationships
  between variables. However, the statistical methods and software packages available
  are limited when we are interested in assessing the effects of several categorical
  variables and shaping different groups following different models. Following the
  framework established by @Lamberti16, we have developed the  [genpathmox](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=genpathmox)
  *R* package for handling a large number of categorical variables when faced with
  heterogeneity in PLS-SEM. The package has functions for various aspects of the analysis
  of heterogeneity in PLS-SEM models, including estimation, visualization, and hypothesis
  testing. In this paper, we describe the implementation of genpathmox in detail and
  demonstrate its usefulness by analyzing employee satisfaction data.
