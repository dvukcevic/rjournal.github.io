title: 'clustAnalytics: An R Package for Assessing Stability and Significance of Communities
  in Networks'
abstract: ' This paper introduces the R package [clustAnalytics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustAnalytics),
  which comprises a set of criteria for assessing the significance and stability of
  communities in networks found by any clustering algorithm. [clustAnalytics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustAnalytics)
  works with graphs of class [igraph](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph) from
  the R-package [igraph](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph), extended to handle
  weighted and/or directed graphs. [clustAnalytics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clustAnalytics)
  provides a set of community scoring functions, and methods to systematically compare
  their values to those of a suitable null model, which are of use when testing for
  cluster significance. It also provides a non parametric bootstrap method combined
  with similarity metrics derived from information theory and combinatorics, useful
  when testing for cluster stability, as well as a method to synthetically generate
  a weighted network with a ground truth community structure based on the preferential
  attachment model construction, producing networks with communities and scale-free
  degree distribution. '
