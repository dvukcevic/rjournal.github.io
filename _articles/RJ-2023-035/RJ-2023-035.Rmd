title: 'ClusROC: An R Package for ROC Analysis in Three-Class Classification Problems
  for Clustered Data'
abstract: This paper introduces an R package for ROC analysis in three-class classification
  problems, for clustered data in the presence of covariates, named ClusROC. The clustered
  data that we address have some hierarchical structure, i.e., dependent data deriving,
  for example, from longitudinal studies or repeated measurements. This package implements
  point and interval covariate-specific estimation of the true class fractions at
  a fixed pair of thresholds, the ROC surface, the volume under the ROC surface, and
  the optimal pairs of thresholds. We illustrate the usage of the implemented functions
  through two practical examples from different fields of research.
