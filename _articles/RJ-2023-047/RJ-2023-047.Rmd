title: 'mutualinf: An R Package for Computing and Decomposing the Mutual Information
  Index of Segregation'
abstract: ' In this article, we present the R package [mutualinf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mutualinf)
  for computing and decomposing the mutual information index of segregation by means
  of recursion and parallelization techniques. The mutual information index is the
  only multigroup index of segregation that satisfies strong decomposability properties,
  both for organizational units and groups. The [mutualinf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mutualinf)
  package contributes by (1) implementing the decomposition of the mutual information
  index into a "between" and a "within" term; (2) computing, in a single call, a chain
  of decompositions that involve one "between" term and several "within" terms; (3)
  providing the contributions of the variables that define the groups or the organizational
  units to the overall segregation; and (4) providing the demographic weights and
  local indexes employed in the computation of the "within" term. We illustrate the
  use of [mutualinf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mutualinf) using Chilean school
  enrollment data. With these data, we study socioeconomic and ethnic segregation
  in schools.'
