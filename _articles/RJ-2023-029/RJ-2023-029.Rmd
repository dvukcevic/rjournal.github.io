title: 'rankFD: An R Software Package for Nonparametric Analysis of General Factorial
  Designs'
abstract: ' Many experiments can be modeled by a factorial design which allows statistical
  analysis of main factors and their interactions. A plethora of parametric inference
  procedures have been developed, for instance based on normality and additivity of
  the effects. However, often, it is not reasonable to assume a parametric model,
  or even normality, and effects may not be expressed well in terms of location shifts.
  In these situations, the use of a fully nonparametric model may be advisable. Nevertheless,
  until very recently, the straightforward application of nonparametric methods in
  complex designs has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive R package. This
  gap has now been closed by the novel R-package [rankFD](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rankFD)
  that implements current state of the art nonparametric ranking methods for the analysis
  of factorial designs. In this paper, we describe its use, along with detailed interpretations
  of the results. '
