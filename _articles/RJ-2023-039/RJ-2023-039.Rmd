title: A Framework for Producing Small Area Estimates Based on Area-Level Models in
  R
abstract: ' The R package [emdi](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=emdi) facilitates
  the estimation of regionally disaggregated indicators using small area estimation
  methods and provides tools for model building, diagnostics, presenting, and exporting
  the results. The package version 1.1.7 includes unit-level small area models that
  rely on access to micro data. The area-level model by @Fay1979 and various extensions
  have been added to the package since the release of version 2.0.0. These extensions
  include (a) area-level models with back-transformations, (b) spatial and robust
  extensions, (c) adjusted variance estimation methods, and (d) area-level models
  that account for measurement errors. Corresponding mean squared error estimators
  are implemented for assessing the uncertainty. User-friendly tools like a stepwise
  variable selection, model diagnostics, benchmarking options, high quality maps and
  results exportation options enable a complete analysis procedure. The functionality
  of the package is illustrated by examples based on synthetic data for Austrian districts. '
