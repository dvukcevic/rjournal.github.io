title: Sample Size Estimation while Controlling False Discovery Rate for Microarray
  Experiments Using the ssize.fdr Package
abstract: Microarray experiments are becoming more and more popular and critical in
  many biological disciplines. As in any statistical experiment, appropriate experimental
  design is essential for reliable statistical inference, and sample size has a crucial
  role in experimental design. Because microarray experiments are rather costly, it
  is important to have an adequate sample size that will achieve a desired power without
  wasting resources.
