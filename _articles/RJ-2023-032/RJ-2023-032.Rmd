title: 'markovMSM: An R Package for Checking the Markov Condition in Multi-State Survival
  Data'
abstract: ' Multi-state models can be used to describe processes in which an individual
  moves through a finite number of states in continuous time. These models allow a
  detailed view of the evolution or recovery of the process and can be used to study
  the effect of a vector of explanatory variables on the transition intensities or
  to obtain prediction probabilities of future events after a given event history.
  In both cases, before using these models, we have to evaluate whether the Markov
  assumption is tenable. This paper introduces the [markovMSM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM)
  package, a software application for R, which considers tests of the Markov assumption
  that are applicable to general multi-state models. Three approaches using existing
  methodology are considered: a simple method based on including covariates depending
  on the history; methods based on measuring the discrepancy of the non-Markov estimators
  of the transition probabilities to the Markovian Aalen-Johansen estimators; and,
  finally, methods that were developed by considering summaries from families of log-rank
  statistics where individuals are grouped by the state occupied by the process at
  a particular time point. The main functionalities of the [markovMSM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=markovMSM)
  package are illustrated using real data examples. '
