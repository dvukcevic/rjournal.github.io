title: A Workflow for Estimating and Visualising Excess Mortality During the COVID-19
  Pandemic
abstract: COVID-19 related deaths estimates underestimate the pandemic burden on mortality
  because they suffer from completeness and accuracy issues. Excess mortality is a
  popular alternative, as it compares the observed number of deaths versus the number
  that would be expected if the pandemic did not occur. The expected number of deaths
  depends on population trends, temperature, and spatio-temporal patterns. In addition
  to this, high geographical resolution is required to examine within country trends
  and the effectiveness of the different public health policies. In this tutorial,
  we propose a workflow using R for estimating and visualising excess mortality at
  high geographical resolution. We show a case study estimating excess deaths during
  2020 in Italy. The proposed workflow is fast to implement and allows for combining
  different models and presenting aggregated results based on factors such as age,
  sex, and spatial location. This makes it a particularly powerful and appealing workflow
  for online monitoring of the pandemic burden and timely policy making.
