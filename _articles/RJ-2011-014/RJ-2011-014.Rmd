title: Watch Your Spelling!
abstract: We discuss the facilities in base R for spell checking via Aspell, Hunspell
  or Ispell, which are useful in particular for conveniently checking the spelling
  of natural language texts in package Rd files and vignettes. Spell checking performance
  is illustrated using the Rd files in package stats. This example clearly indicates
  the need for a domain-specific statistical dictionary. We analyze the results of
  spell checking all Rd files in all CRAN packages and show how these can be employed
  for building such a dictionary.
